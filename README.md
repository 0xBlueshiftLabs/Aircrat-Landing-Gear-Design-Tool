# Aircrat-Landing-Gear-Design

A simple landing gear design tool developed as part of a yearlong group project at university, the aim of which was to fully formulate and design a military maritime patrol aircraft capable of taking off and landing on aircraft carriers.

Tasked with designing the landing gear system for our concept aircraft, this code served as a calculator that outputs the required geometry of the landing gear system given the military specification requirements, as well as our aircrafts own geometry, as inputs.

Creation of this software allowed for complex trade off analysis during our iterative design process.
